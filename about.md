<br/>
I am a Computer Science Masters Graduate of the University of Oxford. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I am passionate about Programming Languages, Functional Programming, Compilers and Computer Science theory in general. 

I have recently been interested in work on Algebraic Effects, Compilers and Compiler Verification using formal methods. My Masters Thesis combined these fields in an attempt to fix correctness specifications for Functional Compilers.
