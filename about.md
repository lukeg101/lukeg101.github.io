<br/>
I am a PhD student at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) in the [PPLV](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) group. My PhD topic is Translation Validation for Weak Memory Models. My PhD is funded by [Arm](https://www.arm.com) as part of an EPSRC iCase studentship. I am supervised by Jade Alglave, Lee Smith, and Byron Cook.

Previously I was a Compiler Engineer at Arm in Cambridge, where I worked on the Open Source [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler, Arm Compiler, and system validation/verification, and testing of compilers using executable architecture specifications, SMT solvers, and formal memory models. I obtained my Masters in Computer Science Masters from the University of Oxford and my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham.

In my spare time I like all things coffee, skydiving, mechanical keyboards, and learning new things. See my blog for more. Previously I was involved in the hackathon community and I used to play guitar. Let me know if you know how to get out of the minor pentatonic rut!
