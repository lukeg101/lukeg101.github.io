<br/>
I am a Compiler Engineer at Arm in Cambridge, United Kingdom. I work on the Open Source [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler, formal validation, and testing of specifications.

I did my Computer Science Masters at the University of Oxford and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I am passionate about Programming Languages, Functional Programming, Compilers and Computer Science theory in general. 

I am interested in Validation, Metaprogramming, Algebraic Effects, Compilers and Compiler Verification using formal methods. My Masters Thesis combined these fields in an attempt to fix correctness specifications for Functional Compilers.
