Slides for the presentation of my masters project at the 7th South of England Regional Programming Languages Seminar [_S-REPLS7_](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/events/srepls7/programme), hosted at the University of Warwick in September 2017.

I presented an introduction to the work on Algebraic Effects for Calculating Compilers for my masters project at the University of Oxford. 

The slides can be found [_here_](https://github.com/lukeg101/Talks/blob/master/AlgbraicEffectsCalculatingCompilers.pdf).
