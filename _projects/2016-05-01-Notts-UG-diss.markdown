My undergraduate project was part of a larger research group in Nottingham in collaboration with Unilever. The project focused on developing a system using Computer Vision (using OpenCV) and a Microsoft Kinect (C++). 

Due to non-disclosure agreements pertaining to a patent I am unable to make the project details public. However my project was awarded the University of Nottingham Computer Science 3rd Year Individual Project Prize; the highest accolade for these projects.

I continued work on this project as a Computer Scientist at Unilever Research and Development in Port Sunlight, Merserside, during the Summer of 2016/17. We presented work on the project to the Unilever global head of research during the annual review.
