This personal website was developed using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. 
It uses Kramdown markup and the Folio theme linked below. 
Uses Cloudflare to provide SSL certificates. This is a work in progress with [_open issues_](https://github.com/lukeg101/lukeg101.github.io/issues) I'm addressing when I am free.
