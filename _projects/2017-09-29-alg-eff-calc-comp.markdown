My Masters project combined the areas of [_calculating compilers_](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/ccc.pdf) and [_algebraic effects_](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nicolas.wu/papers/Scope.pdf) _a la carte_ in order to capture computational effects of compilers using algebraic handlers and thus fix correctness specifications when deriving compiler and virtual machine definitions.

The project used Haskell and the code is available [_here_](https://github.com/lukeg101/MScProjectPublic).

I presented a summary of the work at the International Conference on Functional Programming Student Research Competition (undergraduate category). A copy of the poster itself can be found [_here_](https://www.dropbox.com/s/39ngp0pxfqvlxwi/ICFPSRCposter.pdf?dl=0).

Later I presented at the 7th [_South of England Regional Programming Languages Seminar_](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/events/srepls7/programme) (S-REPLS), hosted at the University of Warwick. More details can be found [_here_]({{site.url}}/talks/2017-09-22-SREPLS7/).
