My first computer science project. Following the waterfall methodology this project focused on taking a local Pet shop from a paper based system to a digital system built using Java. Records are stored using a singly linked list.

The project and code can be found [_here_](https://github.com/lukeg101/IB-Computer-Science-Higher-Level-Dossier).
